# SRBDRP Toolbox
Stanford Rock Physics &amp; Borehole Geophysics (SRB) Digital Rock Physics (DRP) Toolbox. The codes include image creation, alteration, 
and computation of physical and geometrical properties.

## Overview
The analysis of 3-D binary segmented images can be enhanced by various analytical techniques such as geometrical measurements, and 
porous media construction and alteration. This repository includes various tools to assist with the analysis on thin sections or ÂµXCT images.

## Requirements 
MATLAB is required to run the program.
